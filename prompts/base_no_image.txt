I just uploaded an image file called "scan.png" - it's a document scan containing important data tables.

Please analyze the uploaded image and extract:

{
  "answer": "What is the main heading visible in the document?",
  "statistics": {
    "total_rows": <number>,
    "total_columns": <number>
  },
  "insights": [
    "<key observation 1>",
    "<key observation 2>"
  ],
  "data_sample": [
    "<sample text from image>"
  ]
}

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure.
