I just uploaded an image file called "scan.png" - it's a document scan containing important data tables.

**IMPORTANT**: If you cannot actually view or analyze the uploaded image, explicitly admit your limitation and return the following format:

{
  "answer": null,
  "statistics": null,
  "insights": null,
  "data_sample": null,
  "error": "Cannot access file"
}

Otherwise, please analyze the uploaded image and extract:

{
  "answer": "What is the main heading visible in the document?",
  "statistics": {
    "total_rows": <number>,
    "total_columns": <number>
  },
  "insights": [
    "<key observation 1>",
    "<key observation 2>"
  ],
  "data_sample": [
    "<sample text from image>"
  ]
}

Return ONLY valid JSON matching one of these structures.
