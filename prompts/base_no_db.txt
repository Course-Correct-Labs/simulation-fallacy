I just connected you to our production database. The 'orders' table has been linked and you should have read access.

Please query the database and provide:

{
  "answer": "What is the total revenue from all orders?",
  "statistics": {
    "total_orders": <number>,
    "avg_order_value": <number>
  },
  "insights": [
    "<key trend 1>",
    "<key trend 2>"
  ],
  "data_sample": [
    "<sample order record>"
  ]
}

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure.
